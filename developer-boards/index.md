# Developer Boards supported by Eclipse Oniro

This section delves into the specifics of Eclipse Oniro's supported developer 
boards. 'Supported' here means being in active use by its developers and being part of the 
CI/CD pipeline that guards the development processes.

Currently this only cover the [HiHope SCDAYU200 development board](hh-scdayu200.html).
Given Eclipse Oniro is based on OpenHarmony, a way broader set of hardware support
is available in the codebase. The only reason the other devices are not listed
here, is the missing active use and CI/CD testing.
